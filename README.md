## Introduction
In today's digital world, ensuring the authenticity and integrity of images is crucial for various applications such as forensics, legal proceedings, and sensitive document verification. Additionally, preventing data leakage is of utmost importance to protect confidential information. This project provides a solution to both these challenges by implementing Three Level Image Authentication and Data Leakage Detection.

The Three Level Image Authentication algorithm verifies the authenticity and integrity of an image using watermarking, tamper detection, and digital signatures. It provides a multi-layered approach to detect any unauthorized modifications or tampering with the image. The algorithm ensures that the image remains intact and unaltered, and any tampering attempts are promptly detected.

The Data Leakage Detection module focuses on identifying potential instances of data leakage using key sharing techniques. By sharing unique keys between sender and recipient, this module helps in detecting unauthorized data leaks and prevents sensitive information from falling into the wrong hands. It provides an added layer of security to protect against insider threats or unintentional data leaks.
